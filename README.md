# Predictive-modelling-for-credit-card-fraud-detection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. Given the highly imbalanced nature of fraud detection datasets , the project applies advanced data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization techniques to improve accuracy.
Working of the Project
Data Preprocessing: 

The dataset is cleaned, missing values are handled, and features are scaled.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical methods are used to understand data distribution and detect class imbalance.

Feature Selection & Engineering: Important features are selected and transformed to improve model performance.

Model Training: Various machine learning models (such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost) are trained on the dataset.

Evaluation: Models are evaluated using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC score.

Model Optimization: Techniques like hyperparameter tuning, SMOTE for class balancing, and feature selection are applied for better accuracy.

Results & Performance

The model achieves high precision and recall for detecting fraudulent transactions.

The use of advanced techniques like feature scaling and class balancing improves prediction accuracy.

Fraudulent transactions are identified with minimal false positives and false negatives.
